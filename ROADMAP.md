# Echomancy — Core Rules Roadmap (Living Document)

This document defines the scope of the **core rules engine** of Echomancy.
It is a living document and will be updated as milestones are completed.

The final goal of the core is:
👉 to provide a stable, well-tested rules engine  
👉 so that a minimal UI can be built without reworking fundamentals

---

## 🎯 Definition of “Core Closed”

The **core is considered closed** when:

- A full turn cycle works end to end without critical stubs
- Basic Magic interactions are modeled correctly
- Simple real decks (e.g. Elves) can be implemented and tested
- No major engine refactor is required to start building a UI

The core **does NOT aim to cover all of Magic**.

---

## 🟢 Current State (Implemented & Validated)

### Turns and Phases
- Full turn structure
- Normal phases and extra phases
- Correct resume of normal flow after extra phases
- Tests covering real scenarios

### Priority and Stack
- Priority alternation
- Stack resolution
- Spells and abilities on the stack
- CI green with passing tests

### Cards and Zones
- Hand / Battlefield / Graveyard
- Play land (no stack)
- Cast spell (uses stack)
- Correct zone transitions

### ETB (Enter the Battlefield)
- ETB triggered when permanents resolve from the stack
- Known limitation: ETB targeting is simplified (documented)

### Creatures (MVP)
- State tracking: tapped / attacking / attacked-this-turn
- Declare attackers
- Basic attack restrictions
- Correct reset on phase and turn changes
- Extensive tests (including extra combat phases)

### Abilities
- Activated abilities
- Triggered abilities
- Integrated with the stack
- Real tests (Elves)

---

## 🟡 Pending to Close the Core

### 1️⃣ Mana Pool (MVP)
**Goal**
- Support real costs and mana production
- Unlock realistic activated abilities

**In scope**
- Mana pool per player
- Add mana
- Spend mana
- Simplified pool emptying rules

**Out of scope**
- Mana burn
- Hybrid / Phyrexian costs
- Advanced filtering

➡️ Blocks: nothing  
➡️ Unlocks: real Llanowar Elves, real costs

---

### 2️⃣ Costs (Beyond Mana)
**Goal**
- Clearly separate `cost` from `effect`

**Examples**
- Tap this creature
- Sacrifice a permanent
- Pay X mana

**Notes**
- No UI required
- Domain-level tests only

---

### 3️⃣ Power / Toughness + Counters
**Goal**
- Model base power and toughness
- Support +1/+1 counters

**Scope**
- Simple counters
- No continuous effects yet

---

### 4️⃣ Simple Continuous Effects (Lords)
**Goal**
- Support effects like “Other elves you control get +1/+1”

**Accepted limitations**
- No full layer system
- No complex dependency resolution

---

## 🔴 Explicitly Out of Core

These features **do not block UI** and are intentionally excluded from the initial core:

- Full layer rules
- Complex replacement effects
- Fully generalized stack actions
- Spell copying
- Advanced alternative costs
- Fine-grained automatic priority passing
- Automatic parsing of card text
- Expert-system approaches (Arena / CLIPS / GRP)

---

## 🧩 What Unlocks UI Work

Once the following are completed:
- Mana Pool MVP
- Costs
- Power/Toughness + Counters

We can safely start:
- Zone UI
- Stack UI
- Priority UI
- Combat UI
- Target selection UI

Without risk of reworking the engine.

- Each PR that closes a block:
  - Marks it as 🟢
  - References relevant tests
- Known limitations are explicitly documented
- Nothing is removed without discussion

This document is the **single source of truth for the roadmap**.

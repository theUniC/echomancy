# Echomancy — Engine & UI Roadmap (Living Document)

This document defines the roadmap for **Echomancy as a whole**:
- the Core Rules Engine
- the Engine ↔ UI boundary
- the minimal playable UI
- and planned post-MVP expansions

This is a **single source of truth** document.

Echomancy aims to be:

* 👉 an open, transparent, and fair Magic rules engine  
* 👉 focused on correctness, testability, and long-term maintainability  
* 👉 not constrained by commercial shortcuts or opaque rule systems  

---

## 🎯 Definition of “Project MVP Complete”

Echomancy is considered **MVP-complete** when:

- The core engine models real Magic rules correctly
- A full turn cycle works end to end
- A minimal UI allows two players to play a real game
- No major refactor is required to extend either engine or UI

---

# 🧩 PART I — Core Rules Engine

## 🟢 Core Engine Status: **CLOSED**

The Core Rules Engine is complete and validated.

### What “CLOSED” Means

“CLOSED” means:
- The engine is sufficient to play real Magic games via a UI
- All implemented rules are considered stable
- Future work extends the engine but does not invalidate the UI contract

“CLOSED” does **NOT** mean:
- All Magic rules are implemented
- Full rules fidelity has been reached
- No further engine work will ever be required

---

### Turns and Phases
- Full turn structure
- Extra phases supported
- Correct resume of normal flow
- Test coverage for real scenarios

---

### Priority and Stack
- Priority alternation
- Stack resolution
- Spells and abilities on the stack
- Deterministic resolution
- CI green

---

### Cards and Zones
- Hand / Battlefield / Graveyard
- Play land (no stack)
- Cast spell (uses stack)
- Correct zone transitions

---

### ETB (Enter the Battlefield)
- ETB triggers when permanents resolve
- Known limitation: simplified targeting

---

- No gain/loss

---

# 🔒 Core Boundary: Engine ↔ UI

This boundary is **intentional and enforced**.

## Engine Responsibilities
- Own all game rules
- Own validation
- Own state transitions
- Be UI-agnostic

## UI Responsibilities
- Never infer rules
- Never mutate game state directly
- Only reflect engine output

---

## Game State Export ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Engine exposes a **pure, serializable state** via `Game.exportState()`
- Complete export including all hidden information
- Neutral, deterministic data structure

## GameSnapshot (UI Layer) ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Built outside the engine in `src/echomancy/infrastructure/ui/`
- Player-relative visibility filtering
- Hidden information filtering (opponent's hand is hidden)
- Read-only, immutable representation
- Complete test coverage

---

# 🎮 PART II — UI MVP (REQUIRED)

The UI is part of the MVP.

---

## 🟡 UI MVP Status: **IN PROGRESS**

The UI MVP is being built incrementally in small phases.

### UI Implementation Phases

**Phase 0: Debug Console** ✅ COMPLETE
- Developer console for testing
- Game creation and management
- Action submission via JSON

**Phase 1: Read-Only Display** 🔄 IN PROGRESS
- 1a: Route & Data Pipeline ✅ COMPLETE
- 1b: Basic Game Info (turn, phase, life) ✅ COMPLETE
- 1b.5: Starting Hand Bootstrap (NEXT UP)
- 1c: Battlefield Display
- 1d: Hand Display
- 1e: Stack & Additional Zones

**Phase 2: Basic Actions** ⏳ PLANNED
- Pass priority
- End turn
- Play land

**Phase 3: Spell Casting** ⏳ PLANNED
- Cast spell from hand
- Target selection
- Mana payment

**Phase 4: Combat** ⏳ PLANNED
- Declare attackers
- Declare blockers
- Combat damage

**Phase 5: Polish** ⏳ PLANNED
- Visual improvements
- Error messaging
- UX refinements

## 🟢 UI MVP Scope

When complete, the UI will support:

### Zone UI
- Hand
- Battlefield
- Graveyard

### Stack UI
- Visible stack
- Order, source, controller

### Priority UI

- Confirmation / cancellation

### Action UI

## Design Philosophy

Echomancy prioritizes:
1. Rules correctness over shortcuts
2. Explicit modeling over inference
3. Engine determinism over UI convenience
4. Transparency over opaque expert systems

Echomancy explicitly avoids:
- Arena-style hidden logic
- UI-driven rule decisions
- Heuristic card-text parsing
- Premature expert-system approaches

---

## 🛠️ Maintenance Rules

- No hidden scope
- Deferred ≠ forgotten
- All limitations documented
- One roadmap, one truth

This document defines **what Echomancy is** and **what it will become**.

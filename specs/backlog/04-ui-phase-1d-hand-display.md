# UI Phase 1d: Hand Display

## Goal

Display hand cards for the viewing player (full visibility) and opponent hand count (hidden cards).

## What We Get When Done

The `/games/[gameId]` page shows:
- Your hand cards (names visible)
- Opponent's hand count (e.g., "Hand: 5 cards")

## Status

**Placeholder spec** - Will be fully detailed after Phase 1c is complete.

## Dependencies

- Phase 1a complete (route and GameSnapshot working)
- Phase 1b complete (basic game info displayed)
- Phase 1c complete (battlefield display)

## Open Questions

- How to display hand cards (list, fan, grid)
- Card sorting (by type, cost, name)
- How to show card details without clicking

These questions will be answered during brainstorming after Phase 1c implementation.

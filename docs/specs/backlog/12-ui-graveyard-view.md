# UI: Graveyard Viewing

## Goal

Allow players to view contents of graveyards.

## What We Get When Done

Players can click on graveyard pile to expand and see all cards. Both players can view either graveyard.

## Player Experience

1. See graveyard indicator with card count
2. Click graveyard to expand view
3. See all cards in graveyard (scrollable if many)
4. Click outside or "Close" to collapse

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Graveyard shows card count
- [ ] Clicking expands to show all cards
- [ ] Can view both your and opponent's graveyard
- [ ] Can close expanded view

## Dependencies

- Combat damage (11) working (creatures go to graveyard)

## Out of Scope

- Exile zone
- Interacting with graveyard cards
- Graveyard order (for gameplay purposes)
